Part 1: Discussion Questions

<<< Recursion >>>

1. Recursion is when a function calls itself to perform iterable actions.

2. A base case tells the recursion when to stop. Without a base case, the
recursion would happen forever and you would never finish what you are trying
to do.

<<< Graphs >>>

1. A graph is a tree with loops ('cyclic').

2. Graphs don't contain a root and do not represent a hierarchy.

3. A city's public transit routes would be good to model with a graph - it
would be a cyclic, un-directed graph.
